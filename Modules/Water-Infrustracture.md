## 1. Background
Water infrastructure encompasses the systems and structures designed to manage water resources, ensuring supply, treatment, storage, and distribution for various needs. It also includes mechanisms for flood control, hydropower generation, and water-based transportation, such as canals.

These systems range from ancient structures like aqueducts and cisterns, which were used to transport and store water, to modern facilities like desalination plants, wastewater treatment facilities, and hydroelectric power stations. Key components also include flood prevention measures (e.g., levees, floodgates) and stormwater management solutions (e.g., rain gardens, retention ponds).

Water infrastructure plays a vital role in sustaining communities, supporting agriculture, industry, and energy production, while also protecting against natural hazards like floods and droughts. Its efficient management is crucial for resilience in the face of climate change and growing water demand.

## 2. Examples:
Cutzamala water system â€“ Mexico city  
Water supply system to Mexico city: 30% 
Composed of a complex interbasin transfer system
Challenge: Rapid population growth and urban expansion creating higher water demand difficult to meet.
Other challenges : High sensitivity to climate change
Projections: By 2050 the system will be unable to reliably deliver enough water and will loose its critical role as a drought buffer

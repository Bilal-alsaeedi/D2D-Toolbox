## 1. Background
Water infrastructure encompasses the systems and structures designed to manage water resources, ensuring supply, treatment, storage, and distribution for various needs. It also includes mechanisms for flood control, hydropower generation, and water-based transportation, such as canals.

These systems range from ancient structures like aqueducts and cisterns, which were used to transport and store water, to modern facilities like desalination plants, wastewater treatment facilities, and hydroelectric power stations. Key components also include flood prevention measures (e.g., levees, floodgates) and stormwater management solutions (e.g., rain gardens, retention ponds).

Water infrastructure plays a vital role in sustaining communities, supporting agriculture, industry, and energy production, while also protecting against natural hazards like floods and droughts. Its efficient management is crucial for resilience in the face of climate change and growing water demand.

## 2. Examples

### Cutzamala Water System â€“ Mexico City
- Water supply system providing 30% of Mexico City's water
- Composed of a complex interbasin transfer system
- **Challenge**: Rapid population growth and urban expansion creating higher water demand
- **Climate sensitivity**: Projections indicate reduced reliability by 2050
